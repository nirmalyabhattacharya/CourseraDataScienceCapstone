The Shiny app is submitted as part of the Final Project Submission for the Capstone Project, which is a part of the [Coursera Data Science Specialization course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science). The objective is to develop a text prediction model that could show the next probable word when a user types 2 or 3 words that are part of a sentence, similar to smartphone keyboards developed by SwiftKey.

### How to use

1. When the page loads up, initally the text output fields will be blank. _Please allow about 5-10 seconds for the page to load fully._
2. The user can type free text, in the text box below the text that reads **Type a short sentence here:**.


### Output
1. The probable prediction is shown in the text output field below the label that reads **Possible next word:**.
2. The type of _n-gram backoff_ used is also displayed below, for the curious minded.
